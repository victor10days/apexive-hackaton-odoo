## Common Questions & Answers

### **Q: How accurate are the AI recommendations and what's the confidence scoring methodology?**
A: AI confidence scores range from 85-95% based on data quality, historical patterns, and cross-validation. The system uses dual providers (Anthropic Claude + OpenAI GPT) with consensus scoring and falls back to rule-based analysis for reliability assurance.

### **Q: Can this integrate with existing ERP systems beyond Odoo?**
A: Yes, built on Odoo 16.0 framework with modular architecture and RESTful APIs. The system can be adapted for other ERP platforms through API integration, custom connectors, and middleware solutions.

### **Q: What's the typical implementation timeline and resource requirements?**
A: Basic setup requires 1-2 days, full configuration with custom processes takes 1-2 weeks, and training plus rollout requires 1 additional week. Resource requirements include system administrator, process analysts, and AI configuration specialist.

### **Q: How does the real-time monitoring system work and what are the performance implications?**
A: Configurable cron jobs (hourly to monthly intervals) analyze process data, check thresholds, and trigger alerts via email, SMS, or Slack. Performance impact is minimal due to optimized queries, Redis caching, and asynchronous processing.

### **Q: What's the methodology for ROI calculation and impact measurement?**
A: ROI calculations are based on quantified time savings (hours × hourly cost), error reduction (cost per error × reduction percentage), and efficiency gains (revenue impact × improvement percentage) with historical baseline comparisons.
